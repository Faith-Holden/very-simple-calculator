My solution to Chapter 3 Exercise 3 from "Introduction to Programming Using Java"

Problem Descrition:
Write a program that will evaluate simple expressions such as 17 + 3 and 3.14159 * 4.7.
The expressions are to be typed in by the user. The input always consists of a number,
followed by an operator, followed by another number. The operators that are allowed are
+, -, *, and /. You can read the numbers with TextIO.getDouble() and the operator
with TextIO.getChar(). Your program should read an expression, print its value, read
another expression, print its value, and so on. The program should end when the user
enters 0 as the first number on the line.


Notes: TextIO is an IO helper class created by the textbook's author to assist with IO before the book covers java's IO utilities.
